            <p> Hi, my name is <strong> Casey Mensah</strong>, I come from 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana" target = "_blank">Ghana</a> and I am a Junior in 
                <a href="https://www.ashesi.edu.gh/" target = "_blank" id="ashlink"> Ashesi University</a>.  
                I live with my parents and two brothers, in Accra, the capital city. 
                Our country is a very beautiful place and should you ever come visit, 
                <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/things-to-do?g2lb=2502548%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4317915%2C4322823%2C4328159%2C4371334%2C4401769%2C4403882%2C4419364%2C4424916%2C4425793%2C4426347%2C4427774%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517%2C4412693&hl=en&gl=gh&un=1&dest_mid=%2Fm%2F0fnyc&dest_state_type=main&dest_src=ts&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjwmL-6j8vrAhUIwFkKHQcABwIQuL0BMAF6BAgFECA#ttdm=5.510799_-0.232945_11" target = "blank">

            <p style="margin:0;">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. 
                There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late. 
                I like to be surrounded by people.I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream. 
                I like people. And, I like to laugh.  
                <img style=  "display: block; margin:10px 0 10px 10px; float:right;" src =  "images/enid.jpg" width ="190"/> 
                But most importantly, I love good books and movies. I've always wanted to be a great writer, 
                like <strong>George R. R. Martin</strong> or <b>Enid Blyton</b> or a renowned scriptwriter like <b>Tyler Perry</b>. 
                They have influenced millions of people through their books and movies. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. 
                For now, I am just a college student who does some reading and some writing.(that's a coding pun lol) 
                But my dream is still alive, I am more determined than I've ever been and I am not going to give up!</p>
